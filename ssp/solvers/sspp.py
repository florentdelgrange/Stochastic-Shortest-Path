"""
This module contains all the usable functions that concern the Stochastic Shortest Path Percentile problem to a
target set in a MDP.

Furthermore, this module computes the maximum probability to reach T from a state s0 of a MDP with path length
inferior than a threshold l. The module plot with graphviz the unfolded MDP used to compute this probability.

Usage:

    $ python3 sspp.py <mdp-yaml> l s0 t1 t2 <...> tn

    where the arguments
        :<mdp-yaml>: the path to a yaml file that represents a MDP
        :l : the paths length threshold
        :s0 : the initial state
        :t1 t2 <...> tn: the target states of the MDP
